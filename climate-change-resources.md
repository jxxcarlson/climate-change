## A Conversation

If we want to put the effect of emissions in concrete terms, I've often wondered if it would be possible to combine "amount of heating per ton of CO2" and "estimated deaths from famine/extreme weather etc. per degree of heating" to be able to say "taking that flight will cause an estimated 0.2 extra deaths over the next 100 years"

Let's try it out in a very (very) rough manner. There are about 360Gt of carbon emissions left to reach 1.5 degrees of warming. Let's assume that 100M lives are at risk over 100 years at that level of warming (not aiming for accuracy and putting the difficulty of such predictions aside). The average emissions in the US are 16 tons/year. So a year of emissions results in 0.004 extra deaths some time in the next century. The number probably goes up for higher levels of warming, but still, it seems kind of abstract.

I'm wondering if "your taxes will have to go up this much to pay for all the damage from inaction" might be a more tangible metric (and possibly easier to estimate â€“ I think I've seen cost estimates for the US at least).

**ianmackenzie  [8 days ago]**
If you assume that one extra death cuts 30 years off of someone's life, then 0.004 extra deaths amounts to 6 weeks off of someone's life, which might be a bit more tangible

**alexkorban  [7 days ago]**
True.
